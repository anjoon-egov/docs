# KPI Acceptance



Key Performance Indicators\(KPI\) are a way of showing certain insights from the data available which would help the key management authorities to take important business decisions in order to improve the business, enhance the business process and help the people improve the way of functioning. This exercise largely becomes dependent on the data.

The insight could be shown in various available forms such as line graph, bar graph or a tabular format.
