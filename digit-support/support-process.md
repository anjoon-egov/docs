# Support Process

### Overview

This DIGIT Support concept doc outlines the initiative “Platform/Tech Support - Partner/Ecosystem”. The expectation from this initiative is to take the DIGIT Platform and Tech Support to the Informed-Qualified stage from the current stage of Clueless- Rookie. This document covers the scope, approach and 90 days plan. This is to ensure that the Partners who will be implementing DIGIT in the States get technical support to have a smooth implementation.

### Program Charter

1. This program will make sure Partners get the required technical support to have smooth DIGIT implementation.
2. eGov will make sure there are a formal support mechanism and investment in resources to fulfil this initiative. This support mechanism will include scope, mode of support, knowledge assets, Key support metrics.
3. eGov will clearly define the roles and responsibilities of eGov and Partners in this engagement and also the exclusions. eGov will recommend required skill sets from the partner side.
4. The responsible team will make sure that the knowledge assets are reviewed at regular intervals and there is a feedback mechanism to revise them at regular intervals. 
5. There will be a mechanism to leverage insights from the support requests to improve the enablement process, tools, and assets.

### Scope

Scope of this support mechanism covers below-

1. All Selected States \(Applicable to implementation partners\) 
2. If the States are handled Directly bt eGov - The Defined Process can be used by the eGov Delivery Team

### Program Ecosystem/Stakeholders

1. eGov Engineering, Product & DevOps teams to plan capacity required for providing support to partners
2. Digit Implementation Partners/States - Provide clarity on engagement and support that shall be provided by eGov during the different stages of implementation. The State’s Technical team could be a partner as well.
3. eGov Delivery Team - Provide clarity on roles & responsibility and also aid in planning capacity to provide required “enablement-support”

### Program Approach

eGov’s support would be initiated with on-boarding of the partner by the State and would end, for a given module based on agreed duration which could be 3 months but may vary.

This strategy would be executed with the following categories of activities:

1. Enable Partner on DIGIT platform on  technology, business processes,  configuration, and implementation
2. Provide active support with reviews and guidance across the stages of DIGIT implementation
3. Provide artefacts and documentation on DIGIT including Tools/automation
4. Participate in key review meetings with State and Partner
5. Resolve Platform and Product issues

Below are the stages of Implementation as defined by eGov Delivery team:

#### Stage 0 - Program Setup/Onboarding

Set of initial critical activities that are undertaken on receiving a letter of Enrollment from the state. Successful completion of these activities assures that the program is started with crucial personnel, System Integrator\(SI\) Teams, and funds.

#### Stage 1 - Program Kick-Off

This stage envisages the in-person interaction of crucial State officials and implementation System Integrator\(SI\) Teams to kick-start the program. This stage may require multiple interactions/meetings with different interest groups. The principal objective of these interactions is to identify Pilot ULBs, create an active collaboration & Governance approach and agree on a high-level timeline for the engagement.

#### Stage 2 - Solution Design

During the Solution design stage key state officials and members, who are subject matter experts, are expected to share state by-laws and also help interpret these laws for the System Integrator\(SI\) Team. This stage baselines the State-specific product features in the Product Configuration report. 

#### Stage 3 - Configuration & Customization

Configuration & customization stage, spread across 12 weeks, envisages configuration of the product as per the baselined Product Configuration report and identified state-specific customizations. Active involvement of domain experts from the state Team is required in this stage to validate the implementation of state by-laws.

#### Stage 4 - UAT & Go Live

During this stage, the active involvement of Pilot ULB officials is expected for thorough testing of the configured product. Training of the key ULB officials will also be undertaken during this stage, along with the promotion of the solution. The establishment of the State support Team and required processes are initiated in this stage.

#### Stage 5 – Rollout

On successful rollout in the Pilot ULBs, the solution will be rolled out to the rest of the ULBs in batches. Guidance and support from the State Team will be required to create the rollout plans and assure the necessary infrastructure for training and deployment is available at each ULB.

Based on the 5 stages below is the high-level support involvement from eGov side:

After exiting from the State,eGov will be involved on-demand basis. That can include upgrades, major enhancement solutions, and guidance etc.

### Program Capacity

As this is from the eGov offering point of view, this will require a lot of capacity building internally.

### Program Key Metrics

eGov will define SLA and will adhere to that. As of now, it’s not defined.

Proposed key metrics are:

1. The number of queries received from the Partner team.
2. The number of hours spent by eGov members to support partner queries.
3. SLA adherence %.
4. The number of changes required in the assets due to the feedback mechanism.

### Program Risks

1. The internal support team’s bandwidth can get overloaded if Partner’s team is not competent enough.
2. Things can go wrong if the expectation setting is not done right at the beginning.
3. This is an internal investment and will increase over a period of time when the number of states grows. The leadership team should review the investment and take a call on continuity.
4. If after the \(version or system\) upgrade, knowledge assets are not updated then it can lead to more queries and confusion.
