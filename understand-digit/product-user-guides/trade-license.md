# Trade License

### **Introduction to Trade License**

The Trade License \(TL\) module offers the citizens and governance bodies a convenient and transparent means of processing trade licenses. Trade license is the permission issued by the local governing bodies to carry on specified business or trading activity within the authorized area. It is a mandatory document required to run business or commercial activity of any type.  


The TL module enables citizens to apply for trade licenses or renew existing licenses online. It facilitates the governing bodies to validate and approve the license applications.
