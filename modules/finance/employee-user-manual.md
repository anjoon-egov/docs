# Employee User Manual

## Bill Creator

The bill creator can create and approve all kinds of expense bills and record transactions in the system. Finance transactions can either involve Bills Accounting or recording Contra Entries. Bills include expense bills, contractor bills, and supplier bills. Contra entries include recording bank to bank transfer details.

### Expense Bill

The system facilitates a defined set of account heads to be used in the debit side and credit side for bills. This enables users to create bills even without knowing the account codes required for the debit and credit side.  


Once the user selects the bill type and subledger details, the system provides an option to select the template. However, the subledger type is not mandatory. But, if there is a value updated in the template the information will be populated. It is not mandatory for a user to select a template. Users can do the data entry as well.

To create expense bills

Click on the Finance menu option in the sidebar or the Finance card available on the dashboard.
