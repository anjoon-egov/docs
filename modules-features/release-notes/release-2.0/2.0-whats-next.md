# What's Next

### Upcoming Release Features

As a next step, we are planning for the following improvements/cleanup as part of the DIGIT streaming strategy in the next release:

* Renaming of the backend services with a naming convention in place.
* Config \(MDMS, Configs\) Baseline versioning.
* [Readme.md](http://readme.md/) and [Localsetup.md](http://localsetup.md/) documentations for Core, Business, Municipal, and Other services.
* Functional: Introducing advance payment feature and Advance collection integration with W/S.
* Non-functional: Upgrading spring boot and tracer version of all the backend services to enhance the range of non-functional benefits like performance, metrics, and security. Also, all digit services/configs are baselined to follow the Semantic Versioning. These would enable the partner eco-system, system Integrators and state teams for easy on-going upgrades and integrations.
