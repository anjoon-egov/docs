# AP FAQ : What should be the construction date if the existing property undergoes addition/alteration

Suppose a property has the construction date as 10/1/2010. It had 2 floors which were constructed on 10 Jan, 2010. Existing floor details will have the construction date of 10 Jan for both the floors. Now if the citizen constructed a new floor on 10 Nov 2016, what will be the construction date and since when the tax will be charged for the new portion.

so in this case if the addition/alteration has happened in the current installment, then the construction date should be 1/1/2016.  
Step3:The reason the for the construction date to be 1/1/2016 is that the building has been altered from now onwards and the tax that will be altered will be in effective from this installment."

## Solution <a id="Whatshouldbetheconstructiondateiftheexistingpropertyundergoesaddition/alteration?-Solution"></a>

Navigate to the addition/alteration of the concerned assessment number. Add a new floor using the add floor button and add the details with the construction date as 10 Nov, 2016.

The extra tax will be applicable on the property only from second half of the concerned assessment year i.e from October 1, 2015 in this case.
